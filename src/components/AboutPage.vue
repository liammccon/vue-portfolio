                <h1>Hi, I'm Liam!</h1> 
                    <h3>I am a musician and programmer, finishing my undergrad with a major in music and a minor in computer science.</h3>
                    <p>I go to the Cleveland Insitute of Music and Case Western Reserve University.</p>
                    <p>I'm a freelance french hornist in the Cleveland area and have played with orchestras in Canton, Akron, Mansfield, and Firelands.
                    I have also played with the grammy-winning Cleveland Chamber Symphony. 
                    </p>
                    <p>My coding interests are in software and in web development (you're looking at a website I made right now!). 
                    I am familiar with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and more. In fall 2022, I worked as a Teacher's Assistant at CWRU to teach 
                    Java and software principals to undergraduate students.
